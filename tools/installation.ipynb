"MzIO contains 7 different projects. 3 of those projects are essential for most practical applications.\n",
"Those would be MzIO (basic functions), MzIO.Processing (data processing functions)\n",
"and MzIO.SQL (functions to interact with the SQLite database). The other 4 projects are for 4 different\n",
"file formats. Currently supported formats are Wiff (wiff), Bruker (baf) , Thermo Fisher (raw) and MzML (xml).\n",
"The readers for those formats can be installed individually.\n",
"\n",
"Currently, the nuget packages are only available at our github [nuget branch](https://github.com/CSBiology/MzIO/tree/nuget). At a later point they will be released at [nuget.org](www.nuget.org).\n",
"You can either install them from there or build the binaries yourself.\n",
"\n",
"#Building the binaries yourself\n",
"\n",
"* Install [.Net Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)\n",
"* Install the dotnet tool fake cli by `dotnet tool install fake-cli -g` for global installation, or `dotnet tool install fake-cli --tool-path yourtoolpath`.\n",
"* Download the [RawFileReader nuget packages for the .net version](https://planetorbitrap.com/rawfilereader) from Thermo Fisher Scientific and place them in `lib/ThermoFisher`.\n",
"* Open the console and navigate to the root folder of the repository. Then run the command `fake build`\n",
"\n",
"###Important notes:\n",
"####Wiff-Reader\n",
"\n",
"* You have to run the projects in 32 bit mode for the Wiff-Reader to work properly.\n",
"* You need a Clearcore2 license for the Clearcore2 dlls used in this project.\n",
"    * A dummy file for the license which can be replaced is already located at `..\\src\\MzIO.Wiff\\License`.\n",
"\n",
"####Bruker-Reader\n",
"\n",
"* You have to specify the platform on which the project runs, since bruker uses a different dll for 32 bit and 64 bit.\n",
"* You need to install [Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2012 Update 4](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679).\n",

"* For the package MzIO.Thermo you need to do the following steps if you are managing your dependencies with paket:\n",
"    * Download the [RawFileReader nuget packages for the .net version](https://planetorbitrap.com/rawfilereader) from Thermo Fisher Scientific and place them in `lib/ThermoFisher` or another folder of your choice\n",
